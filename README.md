### Code Cafe Online's Anti-Harassment Policy and Procedures

*All Code Cafe Online community activities, events, forums, members, admins, moderators, presenters and guests are held to the anti-harassment policy that follows. In addition to governing our own events, content and members, Code Cafe Online will only collaborate and participate with groups that also offer an anti-harassment policy and Code of Conduct to their members and attendees.*

Code Cafe Online is dedicated to providing a harassment-free community for everyone regardless of gender and gender-expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, or nationality. We do not tolerate harassment of any kind of admin, moderators, members, and guests.

Harassment includes but is not limited to: offensive and/or derogatory verbal or written comments relating to gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, nationality; sexual images shared without consent or in public spaces; deliberate intimidation or directed violent remarks; stalking, following, or private contact without consent; harassing photography, screenshots, or recording; sustained disruption of talks, discussions, or other events; unwelcome sexual attention; unwarranted exclusion; patronizing language or actions.

If a Code Cafe Online member or guest engages in harassing behavior, admins and moderators may take actions they deem appropriate, including warning the offender (either privately or publicly), and banning the harassing member/guest from further participation in the Code Cafe Online community.

If you are being harassed, notice someone being harassed, or have other concerns relating to the activity you see taking place within the community, please contact an admin or moderator immediately. You may contact admins and moderators via Discord DM, Twitter DM to @CodeCafeOnline, in a private chat during a live event, or by emailing emily@code-cafe.online. If you choose to contact Emily via email, please use the subject line "CoC Alert for Code Cafe Online".

Please be specific in your communication and identify:

- the time and place the harassment took place
- the member(s) involved in the event
- any surrounding details you think are relevant to the report

Please know that your harassment report will *always* remain anonymous. The harassing member will never be informed of who has contacted us regarding their actions. If you are concerned about potential retaliatory behavior, please feel free to make an anonymous report via email.

We value your participation in our community and hope that by communicating these expectations, we can continue to enjoy a harassment-free environment.

### Code Cafe Online observes and enforces the following:

*We recognize that everyone makes mistakes. We are forgiving, but not lenient. Repeated violations of these rules and regulations will result in actions deemed appropriate by admins and moderators, including warning the offender and permanent expulsion from community spaces.*

1. **THIS IS A SAFE SPACE.**
    - We aim to be a safe space for all of our members. We consider impact before intent, and prioritize the safety of marginalized people over the comfort of the privileged. This means that, especially as a cis/straight/white person, you might be called out on problematic behavior. Do not confuse the discomfort this brings with being ‘unsafe’.
    - We expect you to get explicit, enthusiastic consent for any manner of contact, including sexual attention, and simulated physical contact in online conversations. Respect boundaries, including, but not
    limited to, the withdrawal of consent at any time.
    - We expect all members to get explicit and enthusiastic consent before sending direct or private messages to other members, excluding the messaging of admins and moderators for the purpose of communicating CoC violations.
2. **WE ARE INCLUSIVE.**
    - Do not engage in racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, sexist, ageist, or otherwise exclusionary behavior, including, but not limited to, any and all forms of shaming, erasure, gaslighting, and victim-blaming.
    - Do not make exclusionary jokes, not even ironically.
    - Do not use offensive, exclusionary, or harassing language.
3. **WE ARE INTERSECTIONAL.**
    - We expect you to be willing to examine your privilege, language and other habits while you are a member of this community, and work on a growing understanding of intersectional feminism.
    - We aim to be a place of learning, but we also expect you to do a lot of the grunt work of understanding basic concepts yourself; use the resources made available to you, search the group for any previous discussions, and search the Internet.
4. **WE RESPECT PRIVACY.**
    - Communication within these spaces is considered private, and each member is free to decide how much, or how little, they want to share.
    - Do not share photos, screenshots, conversations or other information shared within the group with people outside of our community without the explicit consent of all involved.
    - If you have received permission in the past, ask again; circumstances may have changed, and information may no longer be valid.
5. **WE RESPECT OTHER PEOPLE'S CHOICES.**
    - Do not pressure people into discussing, doing or trying things they are not comfortable with.
    - Do not mock or denigrate other people’s choices in sexual orientation, gender expression, relationships, employment, style & dress, religion, food & drink, entertainment, or other lifestyle choices. Your path is not theirs, and the options available to them may well be more limited than yours.
    - Respect the agency of others, always, but especially if you disagree.
6. **NOT ALL OPINIONS ARE EQUAL.**
    - We give no quarter to harmful opinions, and will not entertain anyone
    ‘debating’ their merits. This includes ‘reverse’ anything, whether it’s
    racism, sexism, or any other axis, as well as white supremacy, white
    feminism, exclusionary radical feminism of any kind, anti-semitism, any
    kind of apologism, and the use of ableist language.
    - We believe Black Lives Matter.
    - We are pro-choice.
    - We support sex workers, and the decriminalization of sex work.
    - We celebrate the full spectrum of gender expression, sexual orientation, and attraction.
7. **ANGER IS VALID, AGGRESSION IS NOT.**
    - The expression of justified anger will not to be policed within this space. Tone policing and the expectation of politeness have long been used as tools for oppression, as reasons for dismissal of valid arguments, and we will not be complicit in propagating that behavior.
    - There is no room for aggression, however; do not let your anger tempt you into violating the rules of this space. Use of violent language, and threats of violence, constitute harassment and are grounds for expulsion under the regulations laid out elsewhere in this document.
8. **PRACTICE EMPATHY.**
    - We are all learning to be more compassionate, empathetic beings. When someone brings your attention to problematic behavior, thank them, and apologize.
    - Ask permission to ask for clarification or suggestions for how to do better in the future.
    - Do not debate or argue; even if you disagree.
9. **MODERATORS.**
    - To make sure that the spaces we provide remain safe, we have moderators who will monitor these spaces and intervene if things get out of hand.
    - They have the ability and autonomy to remove any offending posts/comments if deemed necessary, and issue warnings or expulsions to offending members if/when the expectations and regulations of this document are violated.
    - Moderators are volunteers and members of the Code Cafe Online community. If they intervene, however, they assume a greater responsibility that comes with this role, and their word will be law. You are expected to comply, even if you disagree.
    - If you consider a particular intervention to be in violation of these rules, please see # 11.
10. **GROUNDS FOR IMMEDIATE REMOVAL.**
    - We do not condone threats, violence, hate speech, harassment, or any other actions that are deemed by moderators to have caused significant harm or distress to members of this group. Such actions are ground for immediate removal.
11. **HANDLING ADMIN AND MODERATOR MISCONDUCT.**
    - Code Cafe Online is run by volunteers, people capable of making mistakes just like anyone else, and none of us are above reproach or beyond the scope the regulations laid out in this document. Please report any violations of these by admins or moderators to a different admin or moderator, and they will handle the issue as necessary.
